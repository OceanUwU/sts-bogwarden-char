- Boulder Trap: damage upgrade +5 > +7, "triggered x times" wording on the in-combat hint reworded to either "not ready yet" or "ready"
- Energy icon on text now has a little border around it so it looks a little less weird
- Bugfix: Together in Spire no longer crashes when you launch a singleplayer run
